# Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning. The project includes the following steps:
data used: kaggle/input/telco-customer-churn/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv

## Exploratory Data Analysis

In this step, the project explores the data by asking 15+ questions to get a better understanding of the data. The questions should be designed to explore different aspects of the data, such as customer demographics, product usage, and customer satisfaction.

## Data Cleaning

In this step, the project cleans the data by removing all missing data and outliers. The project should also check for data inconsistencies and fix them if necessary.

## Data Processing

In this step, the project improves the target and features by selecting the most relevant variables for the prediction. The project should also encode categorical variables, and handle missing data if necessary.

## Normalization

In this step, the project normalizes the data if needed to ensure that all features are on the same scale.

## Visualization

In this step, the project creates analytical graphs of the questions and answers to help understand the data. The project should create visualizations that highlight the most important aspects of the data.

## Feature Engineering

In this step, the project performs simple feature engineering by creating at least one new feature that can help improve the prediction. The project should also select the most important features for the prediction.

## Prediction

In this step, the project uses machine learning models to predict customer churn. The project should split the data into training and testing sets, and use a suitable algorithm for the problem. The project should also evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and improve the model if necessary.

Note: The code for this project is not included in this README file. This README file only provides an overview of the steps involved in predicting customer churn using machine learning.
